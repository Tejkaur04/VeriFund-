#  VeriFund — Trustless Crowdfunding on Ethereum

> *"Fund what matters. With zero trust required."*

VeriFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum where every donation is held in a smart contract escrow and funds are only released when donors vote to approve milestones. If a campaign fails to meet its goal, donors are automatically refunded — no humans, no delays, no promises.

## 🔴 The Problem

Traditional crowdfunding platforms operate on trust — donors send money and hope it reaches the right person and is spent as promised. There is no mechanism to verify fund usage, no recourse if the creator disappears, and no guaranteed refund if the campaign fails.

In India alone, thousands of online fundraisers turn out to be fraudulent every year. Donors lose faith, legitimate creators lose credibility, and billions of rupees vanish with zero accountability.

---

## ✅ The Solution

VeriFund replaces trust with mathematics. Every campaign is governed entirely by a **smart contract** — a piece of code deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that:

- **Holds all funds in escrow** — donations never touch the creator's wallet until approved
- **Requires donor majority vote** to release any funds via milestones
- **Automatically refunds donors** if the goal isn't met by the deadline
- **Records every transaction publicly** — verifiable by anyone on Etherscan

No platform admin. No central authority. No human can override the rules.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
1. CREATOR  →  Deploys campaign (sets goal + deadline on-chain)
2. DONORS   →  Contribute ETH → locked in smart contract escrow
3. CREATOR  →  Submits milestone request with proof of work
4. DONORS   →  Vote YES/NO on-chain to approve fund release
5. CONTRACT →  Automatically releases funds if majority approves
               OR refunds all donors if goal not met by deadline
```

### Step-by-Step

| Step | Who | What Happens |
|------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Creator | Creates campaign with title, description, goal (ETH), and duration |
| 2 | Donors | Contribute ETH directly to the smart contract escrow |
| 3 | Contract | Tracks total raised, flips `goalReached = true` when goal is met |
| 4 | Creator | Submits a milestone request describing fund usage |
| 5 | Donors | Each donor votes approve or reject on-chain |
| 6 | Contract | Transfers ETH to creator if majority approves, or marks as rejected |
| 7 | Donors | If deadline passes without goal being met, call `claimRefund()` to get ETH back |

## 📄 Smart Contract

### Contract: `CrowdFund.sol`

Deployed at: `0x2d3D8f0e3cad89773205e4Ea4783f129266D17a1` (Sepolia Testnet)

### Data Structures

```solidity
struct Campaign {
    uint256 id;
    address payable creator;
    string  title;
    string  description;
    uint256 goalAmount;      // in wei
    uint256 deadline;        // unix timestamp
    uint256 totalRaised;     // in wei
    bool    goalReached;
    bool    isCancelled;
}

struct Milestone {
    uint256 id;
    string  description;
    uint256 releaseAmount;   // in wei
    bool    isApproved;
    bool    isRejected;
    uint256 approveVotes;
    uint256 rejectVotes;
}
```

### Key Functions

## 📦 Deployment Guide

### Deploy the Smart Contract (Remix IDE)

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create a new file: `CrowdFund.sol`
3. Paste the contract code from `/contracts/CrowdFund.sol`
4. In the **Compiler** tab:
   - Set version to `0.8.20`
   - Click **Compile CrowdFund.sol**
5. In the **Deploy & Run** tab:
   - Set Environment to **Injected Provider - MetaMask**
   - Ensure MetaMask is on **Sepolia**
   - Click **Deploy & Verify**
   - Confirm in MetaMask
6. Copy the deployed contract address

### Update Frontend

In `src/App.jsx`, replace the contract address:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";
```

### Deploy Frontend to Netlify

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Option 1: Drag the dist/ folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop
# Option 2: Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Planned Fix |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Oracle Problem** | Milestone proof is text only — contract cannot verify real-world claims | IPFS file upload integration |
| **Gas Fees** | Ethereum mainnet gas fees make small donations impractical | Deploy on Polygon/Base L2 |
| **ETH Volatility** | Campaign goals in ETH fluctuate in real-world value | USDC stablecoin support |
| **Mobile Wallets** | Only MetaMask desktop supported | WalletConnect v2 integration |
| **Manual Refunds** | Donors must manually call claimRefund() | Chainlink Automation |
| **No Notifications** | Donors not notified when milestones submitted | Push Protocol integration |
| **Whale Voting** | 1 wallet = 1 vote regardless of contribution | Quadratic voting |
| **No Dispute Resolution** | No recourse if donors vote unfairly | Kleros arbitration layer |

## 🧪 Testing the Full Flow

### Test 1 — Create a Campaign

3. Fill in title, description, goal (1 ETH), duration (3 days)
4. Click **Deploy** → Confirm in MetaMask
5. ✅ Campaign appears on the homepage

### Test 2 — Donate
1. Switch to a different MetaMask account
2. Open the campaign → Enter `0.01` ETH
3. Click **Donate** → Confirm in MetaMask
4. ✅ Progress bar updates, donor count increases

### Test 3 — Milestone Voting
1. Switch back to creator account
2. Once goal is reached, submit a milestone
3. Switch to donor account → Vote to approve
4. ✅ Funds transfer to creator automatically

### Test 4 — Refund
1. Create a campaign with a goal you can't meet
2. Wait for deadline to pass (or set 1-day duration)
3. Open the campaign as donor → Click **Claim Refund**
4. ✅ ETH returned to your wallet
